<p>hello my name is mari and I am 15 years old. I live in Tbilisi and the district where I live is called Nakhalovka.one week ago I thought that my life was really boring.in my free time i sometimes learned dances sometimes listened to music and sometimes i walked out with my sister, but now something new has appeared that has really interested me.it is programming.i have been studying programming for just two lessons and i already realized two important things,that i am building my future with this profession and that my life isn't as boring as i thought.this school is called GOA. this school has taught me a lot things along with programming.now I also changed my daily routine. a week ago I was playing games and scrolling tiktok all day and i think that's why i thought that my life was so boring. </p>
